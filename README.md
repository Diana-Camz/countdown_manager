# Countdown Manager ðŸ•’

## Project Description

I almost lost my sanity working on this project, but it's a counter creator as a practice in building more complex objects for me. The counters for Christmas and Halloween are set by default. However, you can create your own by adding the month, day, and year of your choice in the form.

## Features
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Real-Time Counter Creation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/Diana-Camz/countdown_manager.git`
